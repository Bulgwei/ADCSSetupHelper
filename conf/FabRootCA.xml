		Each Configuration File starts with a Config Node.
		This enables us to merge multiple Files into one single XML Configuration when loading
		The Config Node also contains Information on the Schema File that is used to verify the Configuration
		Each CA Configuration must contain at least one CA Node.
		The Node contains all Configuration Settings for a single CA.
		Though possible, I would personally not include more than one CA Node per file.

				A Common reason to remove the Certificate is that it cannot be used for Certificate-based Logon
				(like Smart Card Logon) anymore, which may prevent the CA from taking over Active Directory.
			Note:
				Removing the CA Certificate from NTAuthCertificates will disable the following Services

					use the same Key Storage Provider for the private Keys of CA Exchange Certificate.
					It might be a good choice to change this to a the Microsoft Software KSP to avoid HSM 
					issues like the partition filling up. The CA Exchange Certificate may be recreated 
					every two weeks aith a new Key Pair. Also, you might get avoidable OCC prompts when running

				Description:
					The Pkcs1Version Node specifies the Signature Algorithm (PKCS#1) to use for issued Certificates
					May be 1.5 or 2.1
					From a security perspective, PKCS#1 2.1 is recommended.
					However, many vendors (like Cisco) have not implemented PKCS#1 2.1, thus
					their devices cannot understand certificates from a CA that signs with 2.1
					For compatibility reasons, we will have to fall back to 1.5 in most cases
					There are working attacks on 1.5, which are currently mitigated within
					the actual products that use Certificates
				Default:
					1.5

				Description:
					The SignatureHashAlgorithm Node specifies the Signatuee Hash Algorithm to use for issued Certificates

				Description:
					The PathLength Node specifies the Path Length Constraint that applies to the CA.
					A Path Length Constraint describes how many CAs may follow below this one further down in
					the Hierarchy. For a 2-Tier Deployment, the Root CA usually gets "1" and the Subordinate CA get "0"
				Note:
					- PathLength on a Root CA Certificate will result in the Value being written into the 
					  CAPathLength Registry Key of the CA (not included in the CA certificate but honored by the Policy Module)
					- PathLength on a Subordinate CA Certificate will result in	the Value being written into the CSR
				Default:
					Leave Empty or remove the Node if not needed

			<!--
				Description:
					The IssuancePolicy Node describes Certificate Policies that apply to the CA Certificate.
				Note:
					- There may be multiple IssuancePolicy Nodes
					- No Issuance Policies on a Root CA means the CA will be implicitly valid for "All Issuance Policies"
					  Therefore, the "All Issuance Policies" Policy OID may be omitted on a Root CA 
					- No Issuance Policies on a Subordinate CA means the CA will be valid for no Polcies at all
					- It is discouraged to use the "All Issuance Policies" Policy on a Subordinate CA as this violates
					  RFC5280. If possible specify explicit Issuance Policies on Subordnate CAs, or none.
